Password Generator 

In this project I created a random password generator. Using a series of prompts, the user will decide how many characters the password will be,  and whether or not it will include uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The password is generated by using Math.random with Math.floor on an array of characters based on the userâ€™s selections. I included validators to ensure at least one character type is selected, and that the user's selected password length can only be  between 8 and 128 characters.
